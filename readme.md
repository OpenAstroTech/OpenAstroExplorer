# OpenAstroExplorer

[3D view](https://a360.co/3s8asMz)

v0.1 released now! Test release, please only build this if you know what you're doing and you want to help the development! There will still be major changes to the parts.
**This is NOT a finished design!**

OAE is currently RA only. It will get a DEC and ALTAZ addon in later development. 

There is no official electronics yet, you will have to figure out how to drive the NEMA17. A MKS can be attached with a heatsert on the rear. 

There is no assembly guide! You will have to refer to the posted CAD files and assemblies and figure it out for yourself. You can import the .STEP file into Fusion360.

You will need to find a way to attach your camera, e.g. with a ballhead. This is not included in the BOM. A Camera screw can be filed down until it fits in the 2020 slot to allow attaching a ballhead [for example](https://i.imgur.com/UTugM2Q.jpg).

There is currently no build in way to PA OAE. You can use Sharpcap for example, if you have a guider, or just roughly align it for widefield photography. A more precise way is in development.
