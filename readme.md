v0.2 released now! Test release, please only build this if you know what you're doing and you want to help the development! There will still be major changes to the parts.
**This is NOT a finished design!**

The ALT AZ adjustment is still missing in the current design.

There is no official electronics yet, you will have to figure out how to drive the NEMA17s. 

There is no assembly guide! You will have to refer to the posted CAD files and assemblies and figure it out for yourself. You can import the .STEP file into Fusion360.

There is currently no build in way to PA OAE. You can use Sharpcap for example, if you have a guider, or just roughly align it for widefield photography. A more precise way is in development.
