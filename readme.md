v1.0 released now! 

The OpenAstroExplorer is a compact and portable equatorial mount designed for light to midrange astrophotography setups.

It features a fully belt driven RA axis, resulting in very low backlash and PE, using the same two-stage 9:1 gearbox as OAM. It also includes a magnetically detachable RA ring, a compact worm gear driven DEC axis, and a foldable ALTAZ mechanism, optimized for easy transportation and quick setup in the field. Despite its focus on portability, the OAE offers precise tracking and guiding with a good payload capacity.

A built-in Auto Polar Alignment (AutoPA) mechanism simplifies setup, making the mount user-friendly for both experienced and new astrophotographers. 

While it doesnâ€™t match the payload capacity of the [OpenAstroMount]([OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroMount](https://github.com/OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroMount)), the OAE excels in convenience and versatility, perfect for grab-and-go sessions or travel setups. (It also doesn't weigh 12kg)

Specs
| Weight | Cost | Payload | Performance (PHD2)
|--|--|--|--
| 3kg + Tripod <br>& counterweights | 200-350$ | 5kg | 0.6-0.9" RMS
